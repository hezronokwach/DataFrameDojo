# DataFrameDojo

A hands-on Pandas exercise set for mastering DataFrame manipulation, data cleaning, and analysis with real-world datasets. Perfect for data analysts honing their skills in a dynamic, AI-driven dojo!

## Notebook Overview

`Notebook1.ipynb` is the core of this project. It is a Jupyter Notebook that provides a series of exercises to practice and improve your skills with the pandas library. The notebook covers the following topics:

- **DataFrame Creation:** Learn how to create pandas DataFrames from various data structures like NumPy arrays and dictionaries of pandas Series.
- **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Practice loading data from files, handling missing values, and cleaning data for analysis.
- **Data Transformation and Manipulation:** Apply transformations to columns, filter data based on conditions, and sort DataFrames.
- **Data Analysis:** Perform common data analysis tasks like calculating descriptive statistics, finding specific data points, and aggregating data.
